# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis-NLP

## Introduction
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Twitter data focused on mental health discussions. The goal is to extract and visualize underlying topics from tweets by using methods such as TF-IDF, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and BERTopic. The process begins with data cleaning and pre-processing removing noise like URLs, mentions, hashtags, and non-English text, followed by tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal. TF-IDF is then used to convert the text into numerical form, which highlights important and unique words. Finally, LDA and BERTopic are employed to identify latent topics, offering insights into the recurring themes and public sentiment on mental health. This framework provides a solid foundation for further development and potential real-time analysis applications.
## Requirements
-Python Version: 3.7 or later
- pandas (1.3.5)
- numpy (1.21.5)
- nltk (3.6.7)
- scikit-learn (1.0.2)
- gensim (4.1.2)
- pyLDAvis (3.3.1)
- BERTopic (0.10.2)
- sentence-transformers (2.2.2)
- umap-learn (0.5.1)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Mental-Health-Twitter.csv (local download required)
## Usage (how to use this)
# Running on Google Colab
1. Download the Raw file X(Twitter)Sentimenatal_Data_Analysis.ipynb file

2. Open Google Colab and sign in with your Google account.

3. Upload the notebook X(Twitter)_Sentimental_Data_Analysis.ipynb by selecting File > Upload Notebook.

4. Run the notebook cells (the first cell already installs the required libraries).

5. Download the Mental-Health-Twitter.csv file from the repository to your local machine.

6. When the notebook reaches the CSV import section, you will be prompted to upload the CSV fileâ€”select the downloaded file.

7. Continue executing the remaining cells to perform data pre-processing, topic modeling, and visualization.
## Results
The analysis showed clear themes in Twitter discussions about mental health. The BERTopic bar chart revealed that topics like depression, therapy, addiction, and mental health support are among the most prominent. The frequent appearance of words related to depression and treatment indicates these issues are widely discussed on Twitter.

The pyLDAvis visualization from LDA shows that some topics are clearly separated, meaning they are distinct, while others overlap, suggesting that tweets often mix related ideas. For example, discussions on depression often connect with treatment and support themes.

Overall, these trends indicate that Twitter users address mental health in a detailed way, with both specific issues like addiction and broader topics like therapy and support. This provides a strong foundation for further research and real-time analysis of mental health conversations, helping to guide better public health strategies and interventions.
## Future Improvements / Development
- Developing scripts to automatically collect live Twitter data. This will help the model use the latest information and catch new trends. For example, the script could track trending hashtags and gather tweets in real time, keeping the data fresh.
- Adapt the model to work with live data streams. Processing data as it comes in would allow the model to give quick insights during fast-moving events, such as breaking news or live discussions. This could also be useful for monitoring events like sports matches or public debates.
- Add a sentiment analysis module to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. This extra feature would not only show the topics people are talking about but also how they feel about them. The same approach could be applied to other text sources like customer reviews or survey responses for a deeper understanding of public opinion.
- Build an interactive dashboard to display live charts and graphs of topics and trends. This dashboard would allow users to see updates in real time and interact with the data easily. It would make the findings more accessible and help track changes over different periods.
- Experiment with new NLP techniques and adjust the current model's settings to improve topic clarity. By trying different algorithms or tuning parameters, the model could produce more precise and meaningful topics. This would help the model adapt better to various types of text data and improve overall performance.
## How to contribute
- Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.

## Concluding Remarks
This project shows how basic NLP tools; TF-IDF, LDA, and BERTopic can be used to break down and understand mental health discussions on Twitter. The analysis brings out key topics such as depression, therapy, addiction, and mental health support, giving us a clear look at what people are talking about. This work lays the groundwork for future projects, like tracking live conversations or applying these methods to other subjects. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve and expand on this foundation.
