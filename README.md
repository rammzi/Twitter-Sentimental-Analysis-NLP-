# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis-NLP

## Introduction
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Twitter data focused on mental health discussions. The goal is to extract and visualize underlying topics from tweets by using methods such as TF-IDF, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and BERTopic. The process begins with data cleaning and pre-processing removing noise like URLs, mentions, hashtags, and non-English text, followed by tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal. TF-IDF is then used to convert the text into numerical form, which highlights important and unique words. Finally, LDA and BERTopic are employed to identify latent topics, offering insights into the recurring themes and public sentiment on mental health. This framework provides a solid foundation for further development and potential real-time analysis applications.
